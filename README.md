# Paws 🐾  

### A simple and beautiful way to manage your pets  

Paws is a SwiftUI app that lets you add, edit, and organize your pets with ease. Whether it’s a cat, dog, or any furry (or not-so-furry) friend, you can keep track of them effortlessly.  

This project was built as part of **Section 8 of the Udemy SwiftUI MasterClass**.
